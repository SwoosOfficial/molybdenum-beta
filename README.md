# 1. General Documentation:
* molybdenum-beta is only able to run natively on Unix based systems, where python3 itself is installed to <code>/usr/bin/python3</code>. For all other OS or python installations you should run it via <code>python3 molybdenum-beta</code>
* You need to have Numpy,Scipy and Pyx installed.
* molybdenum-beta is programmed to understand very natural english so an input like:<code>plot the sine function from zero to pi</code>. (will be added in future releases)
* molybdenum-beta automatically adds missing brackets at the eng of your expression. That can be useful!
* molybdenum-beta is female so she is able to multitask. Just tell her the jobs seperated by <code>&</code>-symbols
* molybdenum-beta is able to understand TeX and amsmath syntax (-->List of supported Expressions)
* molybdenum-beta is able to calculate custom roots and logarithms to custom bases (--> List of supported Expressions)
* Dont worry if you spell a function or a command wrong, molybdenum-beta is your best friend and may understand it even though. Even small or capital letters are generally not a problem.
* molybdenum-beta is a very talkative one, if you want to see more of what she is doing just add <code>talk to me</code> or if you prefer to keep her quiet add <code>be quiet</code> (will be added in future releases)
* Even though molybdenum-beta understands english you can also give her any python3 expression.
* If you doubt, just try you will be suprised how much molybdenum-beta understands. There are much more Expressions than stated in the List of supported Expressions!

# 2. History of Changes:

## v1.0.0:
* Works like a pocket calculator, supports all trigonometric function, misc roots, logarithms and exponential functions.
* New Features:
  * Calculate values of stacked functions with constant input.

## v1.0.1:
* The unnecesary files have been removed.
* plot-beta.py is an old (alpha) version of molybdenum-beta combined with a pyx plot feature (will be part of mb in future releases).
* New Features
	*  
 
## v1.0.2:
* Bugfix with constants at the end of the expression.
* plot-beta.py has been removed, the plot function will be added to molybdenum-beta in one of the next versions.
* New Features:
	* Input description added.
	* Now able to understand Python syntax

## v1.1.0:
* New Features:
	* Now supports english language input

# 3. Known Issues
* Unable to interprete spaces yet.
* Not able to plot functions yet.
* If a function is given wrong or unsupported, the program may crash or give you a python3 error

# 4. List of Supported Expressions
* will be added in a future release.
